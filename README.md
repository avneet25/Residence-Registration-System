# Residence-Registration-System-Prototype
(Software Engineering Group Project)


As Lakehead University does not have a mobile application for most of its core services 
such as admissions, student housing, fee payments etc, we decided to build a prototype for student housing on the mobile platform. The application provides dorm information, pricing, meal plan and a payment screen. All the information was sourced form the official University website.
